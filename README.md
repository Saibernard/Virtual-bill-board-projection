# Virtual-bill-board-projection
This repository showcases the integration of projective geometry and homographies. Using a football match sequence, we've seamlessly projected the Penn Engineering logo onto moving goalposts. The result? Real-time, perspective-accurate overlays. Beyond football, this toolkit has potential in augmented reality, digital advertising, and cinema.
