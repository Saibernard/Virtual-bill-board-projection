# Virtual-bill-board-projection
This repository showcases the integration of projective geometry and homographies. Using a football match sequence, we've seamlessly projected the Penn Engineering logo onto moving goalposts. The result? Real-time, perspective-accurate overlays. Beyond football, this toolkit has potential in augmented reality, digital advertising, and cinema.

This repository offers a deep dive into the application of projective geometry and homographies for real-world image projection. The challenge? Projecting the Penn Engineering logo onto the dynamically moving goalposts during a football match, while ensuring the logo seamlessly integrates with the scene's natural perspective.

Leveraging a sequence of football match images, each paired with precise goal corner coordinates, this project demonstrates the power and precision of computational homographies. The result is a meticulously warped Penn logo, appearing as if it's an innate part of the football scene. While the demonstration's elegance may belie its complexity, the processes involved are a testament to projective transformation's profound capabilities.

The implications of this repository extend far beyond a mere football match and logo overlay. It sheds light on the immense potential of similar techniques in diverse domains. Envision the realm of augmented reality, where digital elements harmoniously blend with real-world scenes. Contemplate the future of digital advertising where non-obtrusive, yet contextually fitting product placements become the norm. In cinematic post-production, these techniques can revolutionize scene editing and visual enhancements.

This repository isn't just a project; it's a gateway to understanding the transformative potential of projective geometry in digital imagery. While our focus here is the football match and the Penn logo, the core principles and techniques are universally applicable, offering a robust toolkit for both enthusiasts and seasoned professionals.
